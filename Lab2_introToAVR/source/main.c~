 An amusement park kid ride cart has three seats, with 8-bit weight sensors connected to ports A, B, and C (measuring from 0-255 kilograms). Set PD0 to 1 if the cart's total passenger weight exceeds the maximum of 140 kg. Also, the cart must be balanced: Set port PD1 to 1 if the difference between A and C exceeds 80 kg.  The remaining 6 bits on D should display an approximation of the total combined weight.
